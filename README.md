To update demo page on github:

1. Make sure that you have webpack installed. On Ubuntu, use `sudo apt install webpack` to install it.
2. Build the example in master branch by running webpack -p in react-schema-form/example and webpack will generate a file called form-entry.js in the dist folder.
3. Copy index.html, files in the dist and data folder to the root folder in gh-pages branch
4. Check in gh-pages and wait a few minutes for system to be refreshed.
